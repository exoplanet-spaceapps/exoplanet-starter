## Project Overview

### Background

The search for exoplanets represents one of humanity's most profound scientific endeavors. With over 6,000 confirmed exoplanets discovered to date, the volume of astronomical data continues to grow exponentially. Traditional manual analysis methods cannot keep pace with the massive datasets generated by space telescopes. Our solution applies artificial intelligence to automate and enhance the detection process, making exoplanet discovery more efficient, accurate, and accessible.

### Problem Statement

Current challenges in exoplanet detection include:

1. **Data Volume**: TESS alone generates terabytes of light curve data requiring analysis
2. **Signal Complexity**: Exoplanet transit signals are often subtle and masked by stellar variability
3. **False Positives**: Many candidates turn out to be instrumental artifacts or stellar phenomena
4. **Accessibility**: Professional-grade analysis tools require specialized expertise
5. **Processing Speed**: Manual analysis cannot match the rate of data collection

### Our Solution

We have developed a comprehensive AI-powered system that addresses these challenges through:

- **Deep Learning Models**: Advanced neural networks trained on 7,000+ confirmed and candidate exoplanets
- **Multi-Mission Integration**: Combined datasets from Kepler, TESS, and K2 missions
- **Interactive Web Platform**: User-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing light curve data
- **Real-time Prediction**: Instant exoplanet candidate identification with confidence scores
- **Continuous Learning**: Model improvement through user feedback and new discoveries
