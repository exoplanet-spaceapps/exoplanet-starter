NOTEBOOK 02 ANALYSIS REPORT
================================================================================
Date: 2025-09-30 13:42
Analysis Target: notebooks/02_bls_baseline.ipynb

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. NOTEBOOK DESIGN INTENT
   -The notebook is NOT designed to process all 11,979 samples!
   - Default behavior: Process only 5 sample targets (3 positive + 2 negative)
   - Uses data_loader_colab.py which has create_sample_targets(n_positive=3, n_negative=2)
   - Purpose: Demonstrate BLS/TLS analysis on representative samples

2. CURRENT PROCESSING STATUS
   - Background Process ID: 5c7bc6
   - Script: run_bls_analysis_optimized.py
   - Progress: 22/11,979 samples processed (0.18%)
   - Time running: ~6 hours
   - Estimated completion: ~92 hours remaining
   - This process is attempting to process ALL samples (not notebook's intent)

3. NOTEBOOK STRUCTURE
   - Total cells: 46 (27 code cells, 19 markdown cells)
   - Processing flow:
     a. Environment setup (packages, imports)
     b. Load data using data_loader_colab.py (creates 5 sample targets)
     c. Define helper functions for light curve processing
     d. Download light curves from TESS/Kepler for the 5 samples
     e. Run BLS (Box Least Squares) analysis
     f. Run TLS (Transit Least Squares) analysis
     g. Extract features and compare results
     h. Generate visualizations

4. MODIFICATIONS MADE
   - Created: notebooks/02_bls_baseline_LOCAL.ipynb
   - Changes:
     * Removed Google Colab drive mounting code
     * Fixed paths from /content/drive to local C:\Users\tingy\Desktop\dev\exoplanet-starter
     * Ready to run locally (but not yet executed)

5. DISCOVERED ISSUES
   - Unicode encoding issues when executing (emojis in output)
   - BoxLeastSquares import needs verification (astropy.stats vs astropy.timeseries)
   - Need to modify data_loader_colab.py to process more than 5 samples if needed

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

OPTION A: Run Notebook As Designed (5 Samples)
- Pros: Fast execution, demonstrates methodology
- Cons: Only processes 5 targets, not comprehensive
- Time: ~30-60 minutes
- Action: Modify data_loader_colab.py or run notebook directly

OPTION B: Process All 11,979 Samples (Current Background Process)
- Pros: Complete dataset coverage
- Cons: Very slow (92+ hours remaining), high failure rate on TESS downloads
- Time: 3-4 days
- Status: Already running (process 5c7bc6)
- Note: This is NOT what the notebook was designed for

OPTION C: Process Larger Representative Sample
- Pros: Balance of speed and coverage
- Cons: Need to modify notebook
- Suggested: 100-500 samples (10-50 of each category)
- Time: 8-40 hours
- Action: Modify create_sample_targets() parameters

OPTION D: Use Pre-computed Features (If Available)
- Check if there are already computed BLS features in data/
- Look for files like bls_features.csv, bls_tls_features.csv
- If they exist, Notebook 02 might just be for demonstration

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:
1. Clarify the actual goal:
   - Demo notebook (5 samples)?  
   - Full processing (11,979 samples)?
   - Representative subset (100-500 samples)?

2. Check for existing feature files:
   - data/bls_features.csv
   - data/bls_tls_features.csv
   - data/enhanced_features.csv

3. Decision on background process (5c7bc6):
   - Keep running (will take ~92 more hours)
   - Stop and run notebook as designed
   - Stop and run with modified sample size

================================================================================
FILES CREATED
================================================================================
- notebooks/02_bls_baseline_LOCAL.ipynb (local version, Colab code removed)
- scripts/run_nb02_standalone.py (extracted Python code)
- scripts/execute_nb02_smart.py (execution wrapper)
- scripts/monitor_nb02_progress.py (progress monitor)
- outputs/nb02_execution_log.txt (execution logs)
